==================

Android application that tests SQLite and Realm Mobile DB performance

Created 12/15/2014
Author: Trevor Holton

Purpose: This android application tests the performance of the default SQLite mobile database, which is based on RDBMS,
versus a new NoSQL Realm moble DB, a hybrid object oriented DB. The application performs 100 inserts, 100 updates, and a query
that purposely scans the all the records in the each DB, and each DB has results that are displayed in milliseconds for each
step. This application is not on the Google play store so it must be downloaded and installed onto an Android device to be used.
